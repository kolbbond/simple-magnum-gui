# Encapsulated build of gui parts
# guild 
* the name is cute gui (ld) linker?
1. (i cant spell)

This turned into a straight up GUI library
1. Now we have scripting languages
    * Lua
    * Matlab
    * (Python?)

My attempt at a build system for a combined gui library. 
These are amazing gui libraries to utilize but 
* These guys did not supply a build system <br />
 so here it is.
 1. imgui: awesome lightweight immediate mode gui, for the window 
 2. implot: to aid in plotting, for science mostly
 3. magnum: graphics for 3D
 4. magnum-integration: magnum with imgui
 5 ...?

 The dependencies, git clone into the sub directories
 1. imgui: 'git@github.com:ocornut/imgui.git'
 2. implot: 'git@github.com:epezent/implot.git'
 3. magnum: 'git@github.com:mosra/magnum.git'
 4. magnum-integration: 'git@github.com:mosra/magnum-integration.git'
